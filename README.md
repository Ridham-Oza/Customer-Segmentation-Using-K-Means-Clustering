Perfect, Ridham 👍
I’ll give you a **clean, short, GitHub-ready README** that **matches your notebook**, **does NOT mention RFM explicitly**, and is **safe for MentorMind + recruiters**.

You can **copy-paste this directly** into `README.md`.

# 📊 Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

*(Unsupervised Machine Learning Project)*

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project focuses on identifying meaningful customer segments from online retail transaction data using **unsupervised machine learning** techniques. By analyzing historical purchasing behavior and applying **K-Means clustering**, customers are grouped into distinct segments with similar buying patterns.

The insights derived from this segmentation can help businesses improve marketing strategies, customer retention, and personalization.

---

## 🎯 Objective

* Segment customers based on purchasing behavior
* Identify high-value, regular, and low-engagement customer groups
* Enable data-driven marketing and business decision-making
* Demonstrate practical application of unsupervised learning

---

## 🗂️ Dataset

The dataset contains transactional data from an online retail store, including:

* Customer identifiers
* Invoice details
* Transaction dates
* Product quantities and prices

The data is processed at the **customer level** to capture behavioral patterns.
